# empowernets
Repository containing source code for the Self-Driving Networks workshop on SIGCOMM'18: https://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/~stefan/sdn18.pdf.

The repo contains the files:

- empowerment.pip.txt
- empowerment.yml

These two files contain the python packages at the time we made this repo. Using anaconda you can create a virtual environment
and then first import the .yml file and then the .pip.txt file using pip.
